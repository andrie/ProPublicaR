## Purpose

This package provides wrapper functions to access the ProPublicaâ€™s
Congress and Campaign Finance APIs. The Congress API provides near
real-time access to legislative data from the House of Representatives,
the Senate and the Library of Congress. The Campaign Finance API
provides data from United States Federal Election Commission filings and
other sources. The API covers summary information for candidates and
committees, as well as certain types of itemized data.

For more information about these APIs go to:

## API Key
